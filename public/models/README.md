## Porsche scene (scene17)

The Porsche chapter (`scene17`) will attempt to load this file at runtime:

- `public/models/porsche-911-gt3rs.glb`

If the file is missing, the scene falls back to the procedural car.

### Recommended source (license-confirmed)

A known-good, redistributable option (commercial OK) is the Sketchfab model:

- **(FREE) Porsche 911 Carrera 4S** by **Lionsharp Studios**
- License: **CC BY-SA 4.0**
- URL: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/free-porsche-911-carrera-4s-d01b254483794de3819786d93e0e1ebf

Download it (GLB is available on Sketchfab), then rename the downloaded `.glb` to:

- `porsche-911-gt3rs.glb`
