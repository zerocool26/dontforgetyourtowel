# Competitive Analysis (Feature-level)

This is a **non-copyrighted, feature-level** comparison against three classes of leaders:

- Premium OEM configurators (Porsche/BMW-class)
- Direct-to-consumer product configurators (Tesla-class)
- High-end 3D commerce configurators (enterprise tools)

## Where leaders typically excel

- Model pipeline: multi-LOD, baked lighting variants, streaming textures
- Materials: OEM paint libraries, clearcoat, metal flake, per-part overrides
- Camera: curated shots + “photo mode” helpers (grid, DoF, focal lengths)
- Options: structured packages, pricing deltas, configuration summaries
- Output: multi-aspect exports + video/turntable capture

## Where our showroom is already strong

- URL share/hydration with many interactive features serialized
- Personalization systems (license plate, decals)
- Performance-first adaptive quality (feature gating before resolution drop)
- Mobile-first quick controls and bottom-sheet panel

## Biggest perceived gaps (user experience)

- Lack of a curated “guided configurator journey”
- No structured model catalog with thumbnails/metadata
- No curated shot list (photo mode) and no export presets
- Limited “options” beyond visual/preset controls

## Recommended positioning

- Keep this as a **demo lab / marketing** showroom, but implement a few “configurator-grade” touches:
  - curated paint swatches
  - photo mode overlays + focal length presets
  - option packages (implemented as presets with descriptions)
