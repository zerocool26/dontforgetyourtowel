# High-Level 3D Advancements (2026 Roadmap)

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Modern Post-Processing Pipeline

**File:** `src/scripts/tower3d/three/scene-director.ts`

- **EffectComposer**: Replaced basic rendering with a full post-processing chain.
- **UnrealBloomPass**: Added cinema-quality bloom.
- **FXAA**: Implemented Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing (since MSAA is disabled by the composer).
- **Tone Mapping**: Added `OutputPass` with ACES Filmic Tone Mapping for correct sRGB color output.
- **Visibility Optimization**: The renderer specifically pauses heavy computation when the tab is hidden (`document.hidden`).

### 2. Advanced Material Systems (2026 Standards)

**File:** `src/scripts/tower3d/three/scenes/index.ts` (Scene 09)

- **Physical Glass**: Updated Voronoi Shards to use `THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial`.
- **Transmission**: Enabled real-time refraction (`transmission: 1.0`).
- **Dispersion**: Added spectral color splitting (`dispersion: 0.05`), a cutting-edge Three.js feature.
- **InstancedMesh**: Replaced `THREE.Points` with `THREE.InstancedMesh` for 1000 volumetric crystal shards with high performance.

### 3. Interactive Physics Engine

**File:** `src/scripts/tower3d/three/physics/simple-physics.ts` & `scenes/index.ts`

- **Custom Engine**: Created `SimplePhysics`, a lightweight Verlet physics solver.
- **Spatial Hashing**: Implemented a grid-based spatial hash for O(N) collision detection (vs O(N²) brute force).
- **Integration 1 (Scene 09)**: Shards float, collide, and react to your mouse movements.
- **Integration 2 (Scene 08)**: "Orbital Mechanics" upgrade. 1500 asteroids now have real orbital velocity and central gravity. They can be knocked out of orbit by the user pointer and will physically collide with each other.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Performance Tuning**: Monitor FPS with the new physics loop on lower-end devices.
- **Expansion**: Apply physical interactions to the "Orbital Rings" or other scenes if desired.
